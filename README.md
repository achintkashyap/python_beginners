# Python For Beginners

In a landscape rich with online Python theory resources, I'm contributing by curating a repository of essential programs designed to translate theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Each program in this repository is accompanied by comprehensive code and thorough test cases using unittest, ensuring robust validation across various scenarios and inputs.

## *List Of Programs*

1. Program to count the number of each vowel in a string.
2. Program to sort alphabetically the words from a string provided by the user.
3. Program to handle errors in Python
4. Write a Python program to calculate number of days between two dates.[Sample dates : (2014, 7, 2), (2014, 7, 11)]
5. Find the factorial for input number.
6. Program to transpose a matrix using nested loop.



> *To work on above provided list, we have created 2 modules "Python_Beginners.py" for writing the code and "test_Python_Beginners.py" for testing the code with different scenarios.*

__*The program list will be periodically updated with new additions.*__
